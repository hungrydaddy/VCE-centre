Before I had the sac he even printed us various sac exercises. Also, John's FM class and Victor's EAL class have given me great help. The atmosphere of the vce centre is not like any other tutoring places. The tutors and receptionists are super nice. My dear tutors, I will miss you all!",

Se would elaborate every single detail and exemplify to ensure I understand. When we do not have class, she answers my questions all the time. Not every tutor can do this! Then I'll talk about Steve, he is very responsible for the details. He can also relieve the tension sometimes, especially at Final!",

I feel like the tutors and students here are friendly to each other. This is a place that would make people feel comfortable. I would definitely recommend students from lower year levels to VCE centre.",
